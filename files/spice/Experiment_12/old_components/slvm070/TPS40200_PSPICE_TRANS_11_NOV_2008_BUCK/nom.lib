* This "master library" file calls out the other libraries which we supply.
* It takes time for PSpice to scan each library file.  PSpice creates an
* index file, called <filename>.IND, to speed up the search process.
* The index file is re-created whenever PSpice senses that it might be invalid.

* If the library search times are too long, you may want to "comment out"
* references to device libraries which you are not using.  Also, you can always
* bypass the library approach and simply copy the model or subcircuit which you
* need directly into your circuit file.

* utility subcircuits and models

* Japanese and European libraries

* The following library files are installed if/when you choose to load 
* the Japanese and/or European part libraries during installation.  Since 
* there is no guarantee that the user will elect to install these library 
* files, we have commented out these references so as not to cause a 
* "Cannot find library" error in PSpice.  Please remove the "*" preceding the 
* .lib reference to the library file(s) which you have installed.  
* Please note that once you have edited this library file, PSpice will 
* recreate the index file the first time [only] it is used.  Depending on 
* the size of the library file, this process can take some time.
